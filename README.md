# 📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end Data Analytics workflow**, starting from raw data loading to business insights delivery. It showcases practical skills in **Python, SQL, Power BI, and reporting**, following industry best practices used by data analysts.

The goal of this project is to **analyze data, uncover insights, and present findings clearly to stakeholders** through dashboards, reports, and presentations.

## 📁 Dataset

* Source: Public / Sample / Business Dataset
* Format: CSV
* Size: Medium-scale dataset suitable for analytical queries
* Data includes:

  * Customer / Transaction / Product-related attributes
  * Numerical and categorical features
  * Missing values and inconsistencies handled during cleaning

*(Dataset is loaded and processed using Python for analysis and SQL for querying.)*

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data loading, cleaning, EDA
* **SQL** (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server) – Analytical queries and insights
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation
* **Gamma** – Professional presentation (PPT)
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis and documentation

## 🔍 Project Workflow / Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Loading

* Imported raw dataset into Python using Pandas
* Verified schema, data types, and structure

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Summary statistics and distributions
* Trend and pattern identification
* Outlier detection and correlation analysis

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Handled missing values
* Removed duplicates
* Standardized column names and formats
* Prepared clean dataset for SQL and BI tools

### 4️⃣ SQL Analysis

* Loaded cleaned data into:

  * PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
* Executed SQL queries to:

  * Analyze trends
  * Calculate KPIs
  * Perform aggregations and filtering
* Queries written using **joins, group by, subqueries, and conditions**

### 5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

* Built an interactive dashboard with:

  * KPIs
  * Filters & slicers
  * Trend charts and category breakdowns
* Designed for **business and recruiter readability**

### 6️⃣ Reporting & Presentation

* Created a structured analytical report
* Designed a professional PPT using **Gamma**
* Highlighted insights, metrics, and recommendations
